	<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
	
	<h2 id="liability">1. Limitation of Liability</h2>
	<p>The contents of this website are created with utmost care. However, the provider assumes no liability for the accuracy, completeness and topicality of the content provided. The use of the contents of the website is at the user's own risk. Contributions marked by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. The mere use of the provider's website does not create any contractual relationship between the user and the provider.</p>

	<h3 id="externallinks">2. External links</h3>
	<p>This website contains links to third party websites (“external links”). These websites are the responsibility of the respective operators. When the external links were first linked, the provider checked the external content to see whether there were any legal violations. At the time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design or content of the linked pages. Setting external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. It is unreasonable for the provider to constantly monitor external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, if we become aware of legal violations, such external links will be deleted immediately.</p>

	<h4 id="dataprotection">4. Data protection</h4>
	<p>By visiting the provider's website, information about access (date, time, page viewed) can be saved. This data is not personal data but is anonymized. They are evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes and removed from the log files after 6 months at the latest. It will not be passed on to third parties for commercial or non-commercial purposes.</p>
	<p>The use of the cookie in the contact form only contains the data necessary for processing, such as a session ID, which is automatically removed from the system within an hour.</p>
	<p>The provider expressly points out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating via email) has security gaps and cannot be completely protected from access by third parties.</p>
	<p>The use of the contact details in the imprint for commercial advertising is expressly not desired unless the provider has previously given its written consent or a business relationship already exists. The provider and all persons named on this website hereby object to any commercial use and disclosure of their data.</p>
	<p>The consent to the GDPR/cookie message is only saved locally in your own browser; no data is collected on the operator's side.</p>
