<h1>About this Template</h1>

<div class="uppercase">
  <p>A very simple but effective Templating engine written in PHP. You can just add your own PHP File into the `pages` Folder and the engine will render the content depending on the requestet Page.</p>

  <p>Read the <a href="?page=dokumentation">Documentation</a> for more infors about how to use this.</p>

  <p>Why another PHP Framework/Tempate thing?<br />Because i want to build a small on of my own and all i found was very bloaten and use some template enging besed by replacing Texts like "{{TILTE}}" by a Title String. Here we use ordinary PHP Files for the Template and for the Page Files. This make the Handling easy, if you are familary by PHP. The Engine itself is also writen in PHP (basicly 2 Classes which build the Page whithin his Content).</p>

  <p>You can also just place raw HTML into the Files, but be aware to keep the Prefix `.php` to them!</p>

  <p>Files into the Folders `inc/css` and `inc/js` will be automaticly loaded into the Page Header.</p>

  <p>A basic Navigation is in the default Templates. It will included from the `header.php` File. Feel Free to buld other Navigations</p>

  <p>The base construct is very loose, which has advantages (you can easiely add own changes) and disadvantage (some Changes might be hard to implement).</p>
